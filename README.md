# RefactoringHTMLCSS

## Description
In this assignment I was given starting HTML, CSS, and image assets. The HTML was not written semantically or with accessibility in mind. The CSS reflected the original non-semantic nature of the HTML, inefficiently had a lot of repeating code, and did not follow the HTML document structure . I re-wrote the HTML to follow semantic guidelines, consolidated repeated code in the CSS, reordered CSS rules to follow the HTML document structure, and added comments to both the HTML and CSS files. The original functionality of the webpage has been preserved while fixing one of the links.
